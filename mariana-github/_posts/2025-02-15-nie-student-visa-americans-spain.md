excerpt: "The NIE is the first piece of paper you need in Spain — and getting it is less scary than it sounds. Here's the complete process for American students."

The **NIE** (*Número de Identificación de Extranjero*) is Spain's foreigner identification number. You need it for basically everything — opening a bank account, signing a lease, enrolling in university, getting a SIM card. It's not optional.

If you're moving to Spain to study, you'll apply for a **student visa (tipo D)** from a Spanish consulate in the US before you arrive, and your NIE will be embedded in that visa.

Here's the full process.

## Before You Leave the US: Apply at the Consulate

You apply for your student visa at the Spanish consulate that covers your home state. Find yours at the Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores website.

**Documents you'll need:**
- Valid US passport (must be valid for at least 1 year beyond your intended stay)
- Completed **EX-01** form (national visa application)
- Letter of acceptance from your Spanish university
- Proof of financial means (bank statements showing roughly €600+/month)
- Proof of health insurance valid in Spain
- Criminal background check (FBI, apostilled)
- Medical certificate
- Two passport photos

Book your consulate appointment early — slots fill up months in advance, especially in summer.

## When You Arrive: Register and Get Your Physical NIE Card

Your visa IS your NIE for the first 90 days. But within 30 days of arrival you need to:

1. **Empadronarse** — register at your local *ayuntamiento* (town hall). Bring your passport and proof of address (a lease, or a letter from whoever you're staying with).

2. **Apply for your TIE** (Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero) — your physical residency card. Book an appointment at the local *Oficina de Extranjería* or *Comisaría de Policía* online via the [sede electrónica](https://sede.administracionespublicales.gob.es).

**For the TIE appointment bring:**
- Completed EX-17 form
- Passport + photocopy
- Empadronamiento certificate
- University enrollment certificate
- 1 passport photo
- Proof of health insurance
- Tasas (fee ~€16, paid at a bank with form 790-012)

## How Long Does It Take?

The TIE card usually takes 4-8 weeks after your appointment. You'll get a receipt (*resguardo*) in the meantime which serves as proof while you wait.

## My Honest Tips

- **Make more copies than you think you need.** Spanish bureaucracy loves photocopies.
- **Bring originals AND copies to every appointment.** They'll often keep the copy and return the original.
- **Get there early.** Even with an appointment, offices can be chaotic.
- **Learn the word *cita previa*.** It means "prior appointment" and you'll use it constantly.
