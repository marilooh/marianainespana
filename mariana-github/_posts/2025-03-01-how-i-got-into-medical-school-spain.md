excerpt: "The honest, unfiltered story of how I applied to a Spanish medical school with an American undergraduate degree — what worked, what didn't, and what I'd do differently."

When I decided I wanted to study medicine in Spain, the first thing I did was Google "can Americans study medicine in Spain." The results were either in Spanish I couldn't quite parse, or answered questions I wasn't even asking yet.

So I figured it out the hard way. Here's the version I wish had existed.

## The Short Answer: Yes, You Can

Americans absolutely can apply to Spanish public medical schools (*Medicina*). The process is different from applying in the US — there's no MCAT, no application season in the traditional sense, and the path varies depending on whether you already have a degree or are applying straight from high school equivalency.

For those of us with US undergraduate degrees, the main route is through **homologación** — getting your American degree officially recognised by the Spanish government — and then applying through the **acceso para mayores de 25 años** or through the standard selectividad equivalent.

## Step 1: Homologación

This is the big one and it takes time — budget 6 to 18 months. You'll submit your degree and transcripts to the Ministerio de Educación, and they'll assess whether your qualification is equivalent to a Spanish *Bachillerato* or *Grado* depending on what you're applying for.

What you'll need:
- Official transcripts with an **apostille** stamp
- Certified Spanish translations by an official translator (*traductor jurado*)
- Your degree certificate, also apostilled and translated
- Proof of identity

## Step 2: The Entrance Exam (EBAU/EVAU)

Once you have homologación sorted, most foreign applicants with degrees need to sit the **EBAU** — the Spanish university entrance exam — or demonstrate equivalency. This varies by region (each *comunidad autónoma* has slight differences) so you'll need to check the specific requirements for the university you're targeting.

Medicine in Spain is extremely competitive. The cutoff (*nota de corte*) for most public universities is above a 12/14 — which is among the highest of any degree.

## What I'd Tell Myself

Start earlier than you think you need to. The paperwork alone took me the better part of a year. And reach out to people who've done it — I wasted months trying to piece together information that someone could have told me in a 20-minute conversation.

That's exactly why I created the [free resources on this site](/resources/) — so you don't have to start from zero.
