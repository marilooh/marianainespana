Everyone says Spain is cheap. Compared to New York or San Francisco, yes — absolutely. Compared to what you might expect if you've never priced out European living before? It depends a lot on where you are and how you live.

Here are my actual monthly numbers.

## My Monthly Breakdown

| Category | Monthly Cost (€) |
|---|---|
| Rent (room in shared flat) | €420–520 |
| Groceries | €180–220 |
| Eating out / coffee | €80–120 |
| Transport (bus pass) | €20–35 |
| Phone (SIM) | €10–15 |
| Health insurance (private) | €50–80 |
| Utilities (share of bills) | €40–60 |
| Misc / fun | €60–100 |
| **Total** | **~€860–1,150/month** |

So roughly **€900–1,150/month** is a realistic budget for a student living modestly but not miserably.

## What Surprised Me

**Food is genuinely cheap** if you shop at Mercadona (Spain's version of Trader Joe's, basically). A week of groceries for one person runs me about €40-50. Cooking at home makes a massive difference.

**Rent varies wildly by city.** I was in Alicante before moving — rent there is significantly more affordable than Madrid or Barcelona. If you have flexibility in where you study, this single factor can save you €200-400/month.

**Coffee culture is your friend.** A café con leche at a Spanish bar costs €1.20–1.50. A cortado is €1.00. Coming from US coffee prices this feels almost illegal.

**Healthcare isn't free for non-EU students** — you'll need private insurance, which runs €50-80/month for a basic policy. Budget for this. It's required for your visa anyway.

## What I'd Tell a Budget-Conscious American

Your biggest lever is rent — choose a smaller city if you can, and live with Spanish students or other internationals rather than in student residence halls (which are often pricier and more isolating).

Shop at Mercadona. Learn to cook at least five Spanish dishes. Walk everywhere — Spanish cities are walkable in a way that makes car ownership completely unnecessary.

And get comfortable with the concept of the **menú del día** — a fixed-price lunch (starter, main, dessert, drink) at most restaurants for €10–12. It's the best value meal in Europe and I eat it at least twice a week.
