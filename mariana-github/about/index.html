  <p class="page-hero-sub">An American in Spain, figuring it out one step at a time</p>
</div>

<div class="page-content">
  <p>I grew up in the US, went to an American university, and somewhere along the way decided I wanted to study medicine in Spain. What followed was months of paperwork, bureaucracy, confusion, and eventually — a one-way flight to España.</p>

  <p>I started this blog because when I was researching the process, I couldn't find a single resource written by someone who had actually done it with a US degree. Everything was either outdated, in Spanish I couldn't fully read yet, or written for EU students. So I'm writing the guide I wish I'd had.</p>

  <h2>What I write about</h2>

  <p><strong>Medical school in Spain</strong> — the application process, what it's actually like studying here, how the Spanish medical system works, and what you need to know if you're coming from the US.</p>

  <p><strong>The logistics of moving</strong> — visas, NIE, bank accounts, health insurance, housing, cost of living, and the thousand small things nobody warns you about.</p>

  <p><strong>Daily life</strong> — language learning, culture shock, the food, the people, the pace of life that is nothing like the US.</p>

  <h2>Who this is for</h2>

  <p>If you're an American thinking about studying medicine or any other degree in Spain, this is for you. If you're thinking about moving to Spain for any reason and want an honest perspective from someone living it — this is also for you.</p>

  <p>I'm not an expert. I'm just someone who figured it out and wants to help you do the same. Every question is welcome.</p>
